# Pac-Man Exercise
Description: Pac-Man moves back and forth across the screen once you click on him, and he moves faster with each click.

How to Run: open the index.html in your browser of choice.  Make sure all files are in the same folder.

Future improvements: I plan to make him run circles around the whole page and give him things to eat as he goes along.
